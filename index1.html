It is emerged as a shinto ceremony 
					 
to entertain gods. People believed 
					 
that if the gods were not pleased, 
					 
they would not bring a good harvest 
				

season. That is why, the sumo stage,
					 
dohyo, has been considered very 
					 
sacred. The sumo wrestlers usually eat 

a high-calorie dish called “chanko nabe” 

which is beef stew and vegetables hot pot. 
					 
Young sumo wrestlers consume around
						 
20,000 calories of food a day.  That is why 

they can get fat so easily and quickly.
